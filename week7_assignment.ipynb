        "You may have noticed a slight change in the task descriptions this week compared to previous ones. We decided to elevate the task descriptions to make them more realistic. In real-life assignments, we often do not receive step-by-step instructions; instead, we are provided with a higher-level description of our objectives. However, we understand that this approach may raise questions about how to tackle certain problems. To assist you, we have included the previous step-by-step equivalent tasks below. If you have any doubts, you can refer to [these](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PaNPYVlhQWuEtM-a0B803bIuwZQ8nTHr?usp=sharing) descriptions, which may provide clarity.\n",
